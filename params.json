You can also provide an additional password\r\nto use for any program after logging in, such as MySQL or sudo. bladerunner will attempt to use the host password\r\nfor everything unless you specify otherwise, allowing it to default through sudo in simple use cases. MySQL, FTP,\r\nand telnet prompts are included as well as the default Ubuntu and CentOS bash shells and password prompts. You can\r\nprovide an additional prompt via command line arguments. bladerunner will automatically accept SSH certificates and\r\nwill throw ^C at any command that exceeds the timeout before returning. Commands can be loaded into a file and run\r\nfrom there line by line per host.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n-------\r\n\r\nInstallation is done via the usual methods:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ python setup.py build\r\n$ sudo python setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can install via pip:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ pip install bladerunner\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nRequires\r\n--------\r\n\r\nPython (v2.7+), pexpect and [futures 2.1.3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/futures).\r\n\r\n\r\nOptions\r\n----------\r\n\r\nFor a full list of options use:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nbladerunner --help\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing a file with a list of commands in it is an easy way to execute more complex tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther Documentation\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nSphinx autodocs are available [on pythonhosted](http://pythonhosted.org/bladerunner/).\r\n\r\n\r\nPython 3\r\n--------\r\n\r\nBladerunner fully supports Python 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nPyPy\r\n----\r\n\r\nBladerunner is also compatable with [PyPy and PyPy3](http://pypy.org/).\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe full changelog from version 3.7 onward is available [on the wiki](https://github.com/Demonware/bladerunner/wiki/Changelog).\r\n\r\n\r\nBugs & TODO\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nIf you come across a bug, please create a new issue in the [issue tracking system](https://github.com/Demonware/bladerunner/issues) with enough relevant details and it will be dealt with promptly.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright and License\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nbladerunner was written by Adam Talsma <adam@demonware.net>.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015, Activision Publishing, Inc.\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification,\r\nare permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list\r\nof conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n\r\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this\r\nlist of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or\r\nother materials provided with the distribution.\r\n\r\n* Neither the name of Activision Publishing, Inc. nor the names of its\r\ncontributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\r\nsoftware without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\r\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\r\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\r\nDISCLAIMED.
